h1. touchpaper

A command-line utility to quickly launch EC2 instances. A tasty accompaniment to Fabric.

h2. Installation

bc. $ python setup.py install
$ touchpaper

To try things out without creating any instances, use dry-run mode:

bc. $ touchpaper --dry-run

h2. Configuration

To use a single AWS account, set the @AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID@ and @AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY@ environment variables in your shell.

To use multiple AWS credential sets and favourite AMIs, copy @touchpaperrc.sample@ to @.touchpaperrc@ in your home directory and edit as desired. This will also enable saving of last-used config items.
