h1. touchpaper

A command-line utility to quickly launch EC2 instances. A tasty accompaniment to Fabric.

h2. Installation

The easiest way to install touchpaper is via PyPi:

bc. $ pip install touchpaper

h2. Configuration

touchpaper needs a little configuration to be made aware of your AWS credentials, but that's about it.

To use a single AWS account, set the @AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID@ and @AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY@ environment variables in your shell.

To use multiple AWS credential sets and favourite AMIs, copy @touchpaperrc.sample@ to @.touchpaperrc@ in your home directory or your project root and edit as desired. This will also enable saving of last-used config items (when I implement that).

When you run touchpaper it will first look in the current working directory for @.touchpaperrc@ file, then your home directory.

For info on generating/obtaining AWS credentials, see "this guide":http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html

h2. Usage

touchpaper simply asks you a series of questions to pre-configure your EC2 instance, then launches it:

bc. $ touchpaper

To try things out without creating any instances, use dry-run mode:

bc. $ touchpaper --dry-run
