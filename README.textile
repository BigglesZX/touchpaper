h1. touchpaper

A command-line utility to quickly launch EC2 instances. A tasty accompaniment to Fabric.

h2. Installation

The easiest way to install touchpaper is via "PyPi":https://pypi.python.org/pypi/touchpaper/

bc. $ pip install touchpaper

h2. Configuration

touchpaper needs a little configuration to be made aware of your AWS credentials, but that's about it.

To use a single AWS account, set the @AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID@ and @AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY@ environment variables in your shell.

To use multiple AWS credential sets and favourite AMIs, copy @touchpaperrc.sample@ to @.touchpaperrc@ in your home directory or your project root and edit as desired. This will also enable saving of last-used config items (when I implement that).

When you run touchpaper it will first look in the current working directory for @.touchpaperrc@ file, then your home directory.

For info on generating/obtaining AWS credentials, see "this guide":http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html

h2. Usage

touchpaper simply asks you a series of questions to pre-configure your EC2 instance, then launches it:

bc. $ touchpaper

To try things out without creating any instances, use dry-run mode:

bc. $ touchpaper --dry-run

h2. Feedback

touchpaper is a work in progress and some features do not yet work properly in all scenarios. You're welcome to submit issues via Github, nonetheless, and the open enhancement issues I've got currently filed will hopefully illustrate which bits I know to be only partially developed at this time. I welcome your feedback and contributions, and indeed any attention to this project at all. Thank you.
